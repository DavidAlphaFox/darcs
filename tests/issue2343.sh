# The issue happens when the last line not common was a "boring" line. The diff

FOO
# Here the last line in common is "}". The empty line between "foo(foovar;)""
# and "}" is checked and since it is a "boring" line the last line number is
# incremented, but the line "foo(foovar2);" isn't so the last line number in
# the "newfile" is not incremented and so it makes a bad diff later.
# is important to make a different line from the top
# "foo(foobar);" -> "foo(foovar2);" because if not it will only be an deleted
# line and the algorithm will skip the check of boring lines.
