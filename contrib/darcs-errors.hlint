-- The problem with Prelude readFile is that it's based on hGetContents, which
-- is lazy by definition. This also means that unless you force consumption of
-- the produced list, it will keep an fd open for the file, possibly
-- indefinitely.  This is called a fd leak. Other than being annoying and if done
-- often, leading to fd exhaustion and failure to open any new files (which is
-- usually fatal), it also prevents the file to be unlinked (deleted) on win32.

-- On the other hand, *strict* bytestring version of readFile will read the whole
-- file into a contiguous buffer, *close the fd* and return. This is perfectly
-- safe with regards to fd leaks. Btw., this is *not* the case with lazy
-- bytestring variant of readFile, so that one is unsafe as well.
